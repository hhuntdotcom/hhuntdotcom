 # BEFORE YOU INTERACT ! 

♡ I love to talk about my fixations, stories or my kinnies .. It can get annoying.

♡ I like everything that has to do with fluff or angst, not smut.

♡ I have a hard time speaking or communicating many times, please be patient.

♡ If you don't like any of my attitudes, you can tell me without any problem.

♡ A bit.. slow. Okay I'm a lot of slow, sorry.

♡ I don't like hate between fandoms, respect my tastes.
  
♡ I avoid problematic ships.

♡ When I get comfortable, I can insult (obviously not loudly) but if that bothers you, tell me.
