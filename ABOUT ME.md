# BEFORE YOU INTERACT !

* I love to talk about my fixations, stories or my kinnies .. It can get annoying.
* I like everything that has to do with fluff or angst, not smut.
* I have a hard time speaking or communicating many times, please be patient.
* If you don't like any of my attitudes, you can tell me without any problem.
* A bit.. slow. Okay I'm a lot of slow, sorry.
* I don't like hate between fandoms, respect my tastes.
* I avoid problematic ships, if that bothers you, it's better not to interact. .
* When I get comfortable, I can insult (obviously not loudly) but if that bothers you, tell me.

# DNI

* If you are racist, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic, classist, etc.
* Zoophiles, pedophiles. Disgusting as fuck.
* If you support problematic ships.
